# tools This is a project to generate inventory files for COE buildout, from a spreadsheet of data center information , saved as an MS-DOS .csv file

Using Brad H. s spreadsheet , pick a pod tab, save as csv (MS-DOS), use as parameter for coe_inv.py, run coe_inv.py with no parameters for help/usage syntax

This still has a few hardcodes that may need edits but it generates the critical information (masters.minions, routersets, LBs etc.)

Still a work in progress
